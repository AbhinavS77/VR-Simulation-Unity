# VR Simulation Project

A VR-based terrain simulation developed in Unity, designed for training and
situational awareness use cases. The project focuses on immersive navigation,
realistic terrain representation, and performance optimization for smooth
VR experiences.

## Overview
This simulation allows users to explore a large terrain environment in virtual
reality, helping them understand spatial layouts and terrain features in an
interactive and immersive way.

The project was developed as part of a real-world simulation requirement and
emphasizes stability, performance, and usability in VR.

## Key Features
- Immersive VR navigation using Unity XR Toolkit
- Terrain generation based on real-world elevation data
- Optimized rendering using LODs and occlusion culling
- Performance tuning for standalone VR headsets
- Modular and maintainable code structure

## Tech Stack
- Unity
- C#
- Unity XR Toolkit
- Meta Quest 2
